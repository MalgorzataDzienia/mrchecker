= I can't find the boilerplate module. Has it been removed?

The _boilerplate_ module has been removed from a GitHub project on purpose.

There were problems with naming and communication, not everybody was aware of the meaning of the word _boilerplate_.

The name of the folder has been changed into the _template_. It can be found on the GitHub project.
