= What is "Parallel test execution" ?

Parallel test execution means how many _"Test Classes"_ can run simultaneously.

_"Test Class"_, as this is Junit Test class, it can have one and more test cases - _"Test case methods"_

= How many parallel test classes can run?

By default, number of parallel test classes is set to 8.

It can be updated as you please, on demand, by command line:

    mvn test site -Dtest=TS_Tag1 -Dthread.count=16

_-Dthread.count=16_ - increase number of parallel Test Class execution to 16.
