== Overview

CD from Jenkins point of view does not change a lot from Continuous Integration one.

== Jenkins Overview

For Jenkins CD setup please use the same Jenkins settings as for CI https://github.com/devonfw/devonfw-testing/wiki/continuous-integration#jenkins-configuration[link]. The only difference is:

* What type of test you we will execute. Before we have been picking test case(s), however now we will choose test suite(s)
* Who will will trigger given Smoke/Integration/Performance job
* What is the name of official branch. This branch ought to use be used always in every CD execution. It will be either *master* or *develop*.

=== Jenkins for Smoke Tests

In point where we input test name - $TESTNAME ( https://github.com/devonfw/devonfw-testing/wiki/continuous-integration#initial-configuration[link] ), please input test suite which merge by tags -( https://github.com/devonfw/devonfw-testing/wiki/tags-and-test-suites[link] ) how to all test cases need to run only smoke tests.

=== Jenkins for Performance Tests

Under construction - added when WebAPI module is included.
