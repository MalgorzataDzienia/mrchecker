===== Exporting projects

In order to create a new standalone MrChecker project, you can use template-app-under-test and export it to the new folder:

Create a new folder for the project and enter its path. Select project and files to export:

Then you can import the project to the workspace and create new packages and classes. 

===== Creating new packages

1. You will need two new packages: one for the new page classes, the other one for test classes:

* Create a package for page classes

 Open Eclipse 
 Use the "Project Explorer" on the left
 Navigate to [your-project] → src/main/java → com.capgemini.mrchecker → selenium
 Right-click on "selenium"
 Click on "New" → New Package
 Name the new package "com.capgemini.mrchecker.selenium.pages.[your-product-name]"

* Create a package for test classes
 
 Navigate to [your-project] → src/test/java → com.capgemini.mrchecker → selenium
 Right click on "selenium"
 Click on "New" → New Package 
 Name the new package "com.capgemini.mrchecker.selenium.tests.[your-product-name]"
