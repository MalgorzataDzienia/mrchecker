= Mobile Test Module

== What is Mr Checker E2E Mobile Test Module

== What is Page Object Architecture

Creating Selenium test cases can result in an unmaintainable project. One of the reasons is that too many duplicated code is used. Duplicated code could be caused by duplicated functionality and this will result in duplicated usage of locators. The disadvantage of duplicated code is that the project is less maintainable. If some locator will change, you have to walk through the whole test code to adjust locators where necessary. By using the page object model we can make non-brittle test code and reduce or eliminate duplicate test code. Beside of that it improves the readability and allows us to create interactive documentation. Last but not least, we can create tests with less keystroke. An implementation of the page object model can be achieved by separating the abstraction of the test object and the test scripts.

== Mobile Structure

It is build on the top of the Appium library.
Appium is an open-source tool for automating native, mobile web, and hybrid applications on iOS mobile, Android mobile, and Windows desktop platforms. Native apps are those written using the iOS, Android, or Windows SDKs. Mobile web apps are web apps accessed using a mobile browser (Appium supports Safari on iOS and Chrome or the built-in 'Browser' app on Android). Hybrid apps have a wrapper around a "webview" - a native control that enables interaction with web content. 

== How to run tests

One test case fits all browsers.

=== Pre-requisites
==== Setup appium server

==== How to connect to local Device by Appium Server

 1.
Install Android SDK    https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html#command-tools    ->
	2.
Download Platform and Build-Tools  (Android versions - >    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_version_history   )
* sdkmanager "platform-tools" "platforms;android-19"
* sdkmanager "build-tools;19.0.0"
* copy from /build-tools  file "aapt.exe"  to /platform-tools
	3.
Set Environment:
ANDROID_SDK_ROOT = D:\sdk-tools-windows-4333796
PATH =  %PATH%; %ANDROID_SDK_ROOT%
	4.
Start Appium Server
	5.
Start Session in Appium Server, capabilities
{
  "platformName": "Android",
            "deviceName": "Android Emulator",
            "app": "D:\\Repo\\mrchecker-source\\mrchecker-framework-modules\\mrchecker-mobile-module\\src\\test\\resources\\Simple App_v2.0.1_apkpure.com.apk",
            "automationName": "UiAutomator1"
            }

=== Run on different mobile devices

To execute each test with chosen installed browser, it is required to use specific arguments in Run configuration.

As an argument (in 'Arguments' tab) it is necessary to enter -Dbrowser= with browser parameter name:

firefox
ie
phantomjs
chrome
chromeheadless
For example: -Dbrowser=ie

To restore default settings -ea should be entered as an argument.
